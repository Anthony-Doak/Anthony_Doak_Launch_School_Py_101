write a function that takes a list of integers, and returns a new list with every other element from the original list, starting with the first element

given a list of integers 

set an iterator to 0 

set an empty result list 

while iterator < len(list)

append number in list with index at iterator to result list 

iterator plus 2 (this allows us to skip a number in the list as desired)
